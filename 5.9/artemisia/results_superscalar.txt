=== Superscalar Dimensions ===
Max instructions per cycle (approx) = 1.03
Dependent chain length 16 → avg cycles/op = 19.00
Dependent chain length 32 → avg cycles/op = 11.88
Dependent chain length 64 → avg cycles/op = 5.81
Dependent chain length 128 → avg cycles/op = 5.02
Dependent chain length 256 → avg cycles/op = 2.88
Dependent chain length 512 → avg cycles/op = 6.11
Observe latency per op → pipeline depth estimate
