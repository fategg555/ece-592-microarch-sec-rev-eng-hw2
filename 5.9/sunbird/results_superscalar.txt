=== Superscalar Dimensions ===
Max instructions per cycle (approx) = 0.79
Dependent chain length 16 → avg cycles/op = 9.88
Dependent chain length 32 → avg cycles/op = 6.88
Dependent chain length 64 → avg cycles/op = 6.58
Dependent chain length 128 → avg cycles/op = 7.30
Dependent chain length 256 → avg cycles/op = 7.68
Dependent chain length 512 → avg cycles/op = 7.80
Observe latency per op → pipeline depth estimate
